# RENDERJS

 This code sample is a manual way to send a parameter via a form in html, receive the file using NODEJS server and process that as a string and replace it in the HTML file.
 In this case the variable contains this format "{value}", so our code will look all the variables between "{}" using regular expressions.
 
 The HTML provided is a simple example on how to use it, this is for educational porpose only.
 
 To test your code locally:
 
 1-Open your console and type node renderParameters.js  
 2-Open your browser and enter into your localhost, in this case https://localhost:8080  
 3-Test it sending info via the input!
